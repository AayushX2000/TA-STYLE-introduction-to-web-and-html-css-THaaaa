        <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
    <p>This is the very first time I am trying to create a web page using HTML.</p>
    <p>It is a bit tricky but once u get the idea or the correct Elements, Tags and Attributes and how to place them in a html document, it is a piece of cake.</p>
    <p>This time this is kind of easy as I have to just write a paragraph and nothing else.</p>
    <p>It is not specified how many lines for this paragarap that's why I am ending it here.</p>
    <p>Sorry to say this but I am kind of a lazy guy!!</p>
</body>
